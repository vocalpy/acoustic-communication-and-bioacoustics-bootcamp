Broadly speaking, this field builds systems to retrieve information, e.g. a program that lets a user query a database of documents (think Google Search). Methods for evaluating these systems have been borrowed by related fields, and by machine learning more broadly. For example, one can also conceive of querying a dataset of audio, as is done in [music information retrieval](https://musicinformationretrieval.com/), and information retrieval metrics have been adapted to evaluate the segentation of audio. See for example the segmentation metrics in the [`mir_eval`](https://craffel.github.io/mir_eval/#module-mir_eval.segment) package."

    "We can see that the `'meansquared'` algorithm *with* the clean-up steps has the highest precision and recall. Perhaps surprisingly, the `'meansquared'` algorithm *without* clean-up has a *lower* precision than the `average_envelope_threshold`, and even more surprisingly, it has the highest recall of all. We can understand this as follows: the `'meansquared'` algorithm finds \"more\" segments than the `'average_envelope_threshold'` algorithm--giving it a higher recall--but that also means it returns more false positives. More generally, a result like this would suggest that the clean-up steps have a bigger impact on performance than the methods used to compute the energy and the exact threshold used. Keep in mind that we've shown here is just a demo. To really draw this conclusion we'd need to do an extensive analysis across datasets, and be very clear about our intended use cases for the algorithm."
